# Code Book for Animal-borne sensors as a biologically informed lens on a changing climate

Dieg Ellis Soto, Martin Wikelski, Walter Jetz

This developed collection of code written by Diego Ellis-Soto allows the creation of Figures that accompanies "Animal-borne sensors as a biologically informed lens on a changing climate" 


Fig_1.R: Necessary code to replicate Figure 1 of the manuscript based on the centroid location of a collection of animal borne sensor (ABS) studies.

Fig_2.R: Code necessary to replicate figure 2 consisting on tracks of elephant seals and white storks.

Fig_3.R: Code necessary to replicate figure 3 which compares the temperature measurements of local stations, remote sensing products and African elephants in Kruger National Park

Fig_4.R: Code necessary to replicate figure 4 which compares  the temperature measurements of local stations, remote sensing products and Galapagos giant tortoises in Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. In addition, a model exploration of integrating these data sources is made.

Fig_6.R: Code necessary to replicate figure 6 which calculates revisitation, domain size and others for three target species: Albatross, white storks, and caribou, respectively.
